# License
Permission is granted to use all features of GodzBot for personal, non-commercial transient viewing only. This is the grant of a license, not a transfer of title, and under this license you may not:
1. Generate income at the expense of using the bot.
2. Attempt to decompile or reverse engineer GodzBot.
3. Exploit and take advantage of the use of vulnerabilities.
This license shall automatically terminate if you violate any of these restrictions and may be terminated by GodzBot at any time.
# Limitations
In no event shall GodzBot or its suppliers be liable for any damages (including, without limitation, damages for loss of data or profit) arising out of the use or inability to use the GodzBot Materials, even if GodzBot or a GodzBot authorized representative has been notified orally or in writing of the possibility of such damage. Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties, or limitations of liability for consequential or incidental damages, these limitations may not apply to you.

The materials appearing on GodzBot could include technical, typographical, or photographic errors. GodzBot does not warrant that any of the materials in its bot are accurate, complete, or current. GodzBot may make changes to the materials contained in its bot at any time without notice. However GodzBot makes no commitment to update the materials.
